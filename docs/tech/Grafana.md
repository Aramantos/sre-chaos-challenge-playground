# Grafana

## What is Grafana?
Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and explore your metrics, logs, and traces no matter where they are stored. It provides a powerful and flexible way to create dashboards that give you insights into the performance and health of your systems.

## How this Project Uses Grafana
In the SRE Chaos Challenge, Grafana is used to visualize the real-time metrics collected by Prometheus. Its primary roles are:

1.  **Dashboarding:** Grafana connects to Prometheus as a data source, allowing us to build interactive dashboards that display key performance indicators (KPIs) and health metrics for the platform's services and, crucially, for contributor applications.
2.  **Real-time Insights:** It provides a visual interface to observe how applications are performing under various challenge conditions, helping contributors understand the impact of their optimizations or chaos experiments.
3.  **Troubleshooting:** By visualizing metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, request rates, and error rates, Grafana aids in quickly identifying bottlenecks or issues within deployed services.

## How You Can Use Grafana Integration (Monitoring Your Contributor App)

As a contributor, Grafana is your window into your application's performance. Your focus will be on leveraging Grafana to monitor *your own deployed application*:

*   **Explore Your Metrics:** After deploying your application, use Grafana to explore the metrics Prometheus is collecting from *your app*. This helps you verify that your application is being scraped correctly and understand the data available for scoring.
*   **Build Custom Dashboards:** You are encouraged to create your own custom Grafana dashboards to gain deeper insights into *your application's* specific behavior and optimize it for the challenges. This is a great way to demonstrate your observability skills.
*   **Monitor Your Progress:** Use Grafana to monitor *your application's* performance in real-time as you implement changes or run tests. This immediate feedback loop is essential for SRE practices.

**Note:** Direct contributions to the core Grafana setup or platform-level dashboards are generally not accepted for Hacktoberfest. If you have suggestions for platform-level improvements, please open an issue.
