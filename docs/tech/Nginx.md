# Nginx

## What is Nginx?
Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a powerful, open-source web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, HTTP cache, and load balancer. It is known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.

## How this Project Uses Nginx
Nginx plays several crucial roles in the SRE Chaos Challenge project:

1.  **Frontend Static File Server:** The `frontend` service uses Nginx to efficiently serve the static Angular application files to the user's browser. This is a common and performant way to deploy single-page applications.
2.  **Contributor Application Web Server:** Each contributor's application (e.g., `your-username-app`) is typically an Nginx web server. This provides a consistent and controlled environment for contributors to deploy their web services.
3.  **Metric Exposure:** For contributor applications, Nginx is configured to expose its `/stub_status` endpoint. This endpoint provides basic Nginx performance metrics (like active connections, requests processed) which are then scraped by Prometheus via an `nginx-prometheus-exporter` sidecar.
4.  **Reverse Proxy (Future/Advanced):** In more complex scenarios or for advanced challenges, Nginx can be configured as a reverse proxy to route traffic, handle SSL termination, or implement load balancing for contributor applications.

## How You Can Use Nginx Integration (Within Your Contributor App)

Understanding Nginx is vital for deploying and optimizing your contributor application. Your focus will be on configuring Nginx *within your own deployed application*:

*   **Customizing Your App:** You can modify the `nginx.conf` file within your `contributors/<your-username>/` directory to customize how your web application behaves. This includes:
    *   Serving different static content.
    *   Configuring caching.
    *   Setting up custom error pages.
    *   Implementing more advanced routing rules.
*   **Metric Configuration:** Ensure your Nginx configuration correctly exposes the `/stub_status` endpoint if you are using the `nginx-prometheus-exporter` to provide metrics to the platform.
*   **Performance Tuning:** Optimize Nginx settings (e.g., worker processes, buffer sizes, keepalive timeouts) within your `Dockerfile` or `nginx.conf` to improve your application's performance and resilience under load.
*   **Advanced Features:** Explore Nginx's capabilities for load balancing, rate limiting, or request filtering as part of your challenge solution.

**Note:** Direct contributions to the core Nginx configuration for the platform's services (e.g., the frontend's Nginx) are generally not accepted for Hacktoberfest. If you have suggestions for platform-level improvements, please open an issue.
